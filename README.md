# Knowledge Cards

A local flashcard app for knowledge points — maths, computer science, exam
material. Runs a small Python server on your own machine and opens in a browser.
No account, no network, no cloud; everything lives in one SQLite file.

Cards are written by an LLM and pasted in as JSON. The app schedules them and
gets out of the way.

## Running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

That starts a server on `127.0.0.1:8737` and opens your browser. `Ctrl-C` stops it.

```bash
python main.py --no-browser      # run without opening a browser
python main.py --port 9000       # use a different port
```

The server binds to loopback only and refuses cross-origin requests, so nothing
else on your network — or in another browser tab — can reach it.

## The two halves

**Cards** are persistent. Front, back, scheduled by
[FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/py-fsrs). You grade yourself
`Again / Hard / Good / Easy` (keys `1`–`4`), because a flashcard has no answer a
machine can check.

**Quizzes** are one-off. A fixed set of questions — multiple choice, cloze, short
answer, ordering — with the answer key written into the JSON. The app marks them,
so there is no self-rating, and nothing you do in a quiz touches any card's
schedule.

Leaving either one costs nothing. Each card rating and each graded quiz question
is written when you make it, so `Esc` mid-way loses no work: a card review simply
leaves the rest still due, and a quiz offers *Resume* where you stopped, across
a browser reload. *Start over* discards the run and begins again.

The two never mix. That is the whole design.

## Daily limits

Every subject has its own cap on new cards and reviews per day. Anything beyond
the cap simply does not appear. Two weeks away does not build a wall: the day you
come back you are offered one day's worth, like any other day.

Limits belong to top-level decks. Studying a chapter draws from its subject's
budget rather than getting a fresh one, and studying "all decks" walks each
subject's budget separately instead of merging them into a single pool.

There are no streaks and no targets. *Study more* on the finish screen ignores
the cap for that sitting and changes nothing about tomorrow. *Browse* reads
through a deck without scheduling anything at all.

## Importing

Paste JSON into the Import page. It previews exactly what it would do before
writing anything, and skips bad entries rather than rejecting the whole paste.

*Copy deck names* puts every existing deck path on your clipboard, sub-decks
included, so whatever writes the JSON files the cards under a deck you already
have instead of inventing one beside it. The format itself belongs to the
authoring skill below, which is where it stays in step with the importer.

The format is documented in [docs/SCHEMA.md](docs/SCHEMA.md). Sample files live
in [samples/](samples/).

## Handing your progress to an AI

The app does not explain, coach or generate; your AI conversation does. What
the app owes that conversation is data it can read cold, so three places offer
a one-click copy, each a sentence of framing plus versioned JSON:

- **Quiz results** · *Copy for AI*: the questions you got wrong, your answers
  and the correct ones.
- **Session finished** · *Copy struggles*: the cards you just rated Again or
  Hard, with their ids.
- **Stats** · *Export study report*: every subject's state, limits, the next
  week's load, recall rates and quiz history, for planning.

Card ids make the loop closed: ask for a struggling card to be rewritten, keep
its id, re-import, and the card updates in place instead of duplicating.

## Window layout

Every page opens with the same two lines: a small label and a title, at a fixed
height. Nothing else goes in that header, so the title sits at the same y and the
first card starts at the same y on all six pages. Controls live under the header,
in the content, rather than in a corner.

The left column is mounted on every page so nothing shifts as you navigate, and
each page decides what belongs in it: decks where the page is scoped by deck,
subjects on Quiz, its own sections on Settings. Its header reserves the space for
an action whether or not that page has one, so the first row of the list lines up
across all six.

The document never scrolls. The shell is exactly the viewport height, the top bar
and deck sidebar sit outside the scroll container, and only the content pane
scrolls, so a scrollbar appearing on a long page cannot move any control. The
pane also reserves its own scrollbar track, so its contents stay put too.

Colour carries one meaning. New, Learning and Review are three shades of a single
blue-to-ink ramp rather than three unrelated hues, and so are the heatmap and
every bar in the app; red appears only where a quiz has actually marked something
wrong.

## Keyboard

| Key | Where | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `Space` | reviewing | show the answer |
| `1` `2` `3` `4` | reviewing | Again / Hard / Good / Easy |
| `E` | reviewing | edit the current card in place |
| `Z` | reviewing | undo the last rating |
| `H` | reviewing | show the hint |
| `←` `→` | browsing | previous / next card |
| `1`…`9` | quiz | pick an option |
| `Enter` | quiz | check, then advance |
| `Esc` | anywhere | leave the session |

## Data

One SQLite file, plus a log:

| Platform | Location |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/KnowledgeCards/` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/KnowledgeCards/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\KnowledgeCards\` |

`KC_USER_DATA=/some/path` points the app somewhere else, which is how the tests
run against a throwaway directory.

*Export cards* on the Cards page downloads the selected deck as a JSON file,
and Settings has *Export all cards* for the whole library in one file; both are
in exactly the format Import accepts back. Copy `knowledge.db` for a complete
backup including schedules and history.

## Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest tests/            # repositories, services, HTTP, skill validator
node tests/e2e/interaction.mjs     # browser pass over every screen
```

The e2e run needs Playwright and a server already running on port 8737.

## Authoring cards

`.claude/skills/knowledge-cards/` is a Claude Code skill that standardises how
cards get written: deck and quiz naming, field conventions, the atomicity rule,
and the distractor rules for quiz questions. Deck names are course names, never
syllabus codes, and the validator says so. Ask Claude for cards inside this repository
and it applies automatically; elsewhere, copy the folder into that project's
`.claude/skills/`.

The skill is self-contained: every field name, every rule and two worked
examples live inside its own folder, so copying the folder is enough. It ships a
validator and requires running it before handing anything over:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/knowledge-cards/scripts/validate_cards.py cards.json --strict
```

Errors are things the app would reject or silently mishandle; warnings are
authoring rules. Standard library only, so it runs wherever the skill is copied.
`tests/test_skill_validator.py` asserts the validator flags everything the app's
importer rejects, so the two cannot drift apart, and holds `samples/` to a clean
`--strict` run.

The skill hands its output over as a **file**, not as JSON pasted into the chat —
a 90-card object is unusable as a code block, and the validated bytes are the
ones on disk.

To distribute or install it, package the folder into a `.skill` file (a zip
variant that Claude can install directly):

```bash
python3 -m scripts.package_skill /path/to/Flash_Card_App/.claude/skills/knowledge-cards
```

Run that from the `skill-creator` skill's directory. The resulting
`knowledge-cards.skill` is a build artifact and is not committed.

Without the skill, the format is in [docs/SCHEMA.md](docs/SCHEMA.md), and the
Import page's *Copy deck names* button supplies the one thing a document cannot:
the decks this particular library already has.

## Language

English and 中文, switched in Settings. Card content is never translated.

The Latin face is Archivo, bundled in `web/vendor/fonts` rather than fetched.
No Chinese face is bundled, because a CJK font is megabytes even subsetted; the
system face is used instead, and `base.css` maps the heavy weights onto a real
cut so nothing is rendered as a synthesised bold.
