# Import format

Everything enters the app as JSON pasted into the Import page. There are two
shapes, and they are unrelated to each other:

| Shape | What it is | Scheduled? | Counts against daily limits? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cards` | Persistent flashcards, front and back | Yes, by FSRS | Yes |
| `quiz` | A fixed question set you take on demand | No | No |

A quiz question never attaches to a card, and a card never carries questions.
Deleting every card in a subject leaves its quizzes untouched, and taking a quiz
changes nothing about what is due.

Both shapes may appear in the same object.

## Cards

```jsonc
{
  "deck": "Mathematics::Linear Algebra",   // default deck for every card below
  "cards": [
    {
      "front": "Define an eigenvector of $A$",
      "back": "A **nonzero** vector $v$ such that $Av = \\lambda v$.",
      "hint": "think about direction",     // optional, revealed on request
      "tags": ["definition", "exam"],      // optional
      "id": "la.eigenvector.def",          // optional, see below
      "deck": "Mathematics::Other"         // optional, overrides the top-level deck
    }
  ]
}
```

**Required:** `front`, `back`, and a deck (either per card or at the top level).

**Decks** are a tree written with `::`. `Mathematics::Linear Algebra::Eigenvalues`
creates all three levels. Daily limits belong to the top level, the subject, so
that level must be the name of the course: `Mathematics`, not `9709`; `Computer
Science`, not `9618`. A syllabus code goes in `tags`, where it is searchable and
does not split one course into two budgets. The Import page's *Copy deck names*
button lists the paths that already exist.

**`id`** makes an import repeatable. A card with an `id` that already exists is
updated in place rather than duplicated, so you can hand a deck back to an LLM,
have it revise the wording, and re-import without creating a second copy.

Without an `id`, a card whose `front` already exists in the same deck is reported
as a duplicate and skipped. Tick *Import duplicates too* to override that.

## Quizzes

```jsonc
{
  "quiz": {
    "name": "Linear Algebra — Ch.3",
    "subject": "Mathematics",              // optional, groups the quiz list
    "id": "la.ch3",                        // optional; re-import replaces this quiz
    "questions": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

Use `"quizzes": [ ... ]` to import several at once.

Re-importing a quiz compares its question list against the stored one first.
Identical, in the same order, and nothing is written: the preview says
*unchanged*, and a half-finished run of that quiz survives. If anything did
change, the list is replaced wholesale and that run is discarded in the same
step, because its saved answers point at questions that no longer exist. Past
attempt scores are kept either way.

### Question types

**`mcq`** — the options and the answer key are yours. The app never generates
distractors.

```jsonc
{ "type": "mcq",
  "prompt": "Which is NOT a vector space axiom?",
  "options": ["Closure under addition",
              "A multiplicative inverse for every vector",
              "Associativity of addition",
              "Existence of a zero vector"],
  "answer": 1,                             // option index; [0, 2] for multi-answer
  "explain": "Vector spaces need additive inverses, not multiplicative ones." }
```

Single-answer questions submit on click. Multi-answer questions toggle and wait
for *Check*.

**`cloze`** — you decide what is hidden. The app never picks blanks itself.

```jsonc
{ "type": "cloze",
  "text": "rank(A) + {{nullity(A)}} = {{n|dim V}}",
  "match": "loose",                        // optional: "loose" (default) or "exact"
  "explain": "Rank-nullity theorem." }
```

Each `{{...}}` is one blank. Alternatives are separated by `|`; the first is what
gets shown as the answer.

**`short`** — graded against the list you supply.

```jsonc
{ "type": "short",
  "prompt": "Symbol conventionally used for an eigenvalue?",
  "answers": ["lambda", "λ"],
  "match": "loose" }
```

**`ordering`** — `items` are written in the correct order and shuffled for you.

```jsonc
{ "type": "ordering",
  "prompt": "Order the steps of Gaussian elimination",
  "items": ["Forward elimination to row echelon form",
            "Back substitution",
            "Read off the solution"] }
```

### Matching

`match: "loose"` (the default) lowercases, collapses whitespace, and strips
punctuation, including full-width CJK punctuation. What survives is compared for
**exact equality** against each accepted answer, normalised the same way. There
is no fuzzy matching: no edit distance, no stemming, no substring, no synonyms.
`the derivative` does not match `derivative`, and `λ` does not match `lambda`,
so list every form you will accept.

Numbers are the one exception to the punctuation sweep. A decimal point between
two digits is kept, because deleting it made `1.5` and `15` the same answer; a
leading `.5` is read as `0.5`. A comma between digits *is* deleted, so `1,024`
and `1024` match. Trailing zeros are significant: `0.50` does not match `0.5`.

`match: "exact"` compares the trimmed string as written; use it when the precise
form is the point.

A cloze with several blanks is right only when every blank is right. Each blank
is marked individually on screen, but the question scores as one.

### Unknown types

A question whose `type` is not one of the four above is reported as a warning at
import time and dropped. The rest of the quiz imports normally.

## Text formatting

Both card text and question text accept:

- **Maths** — `$...$` inline, `$$...$$` display, TeX syntax, rendered by a
  bundled copy of KaTeX. No network access is involved.
- **Markdown**, a small subset: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, `- ` bullet
  lists, `1. ` numbered lists, and blank lines between paragraphs.

Remember that JSON needs its backslashes doubled: `$Av = \\lambda v$`.

---

## Export

*Cards → Export cards* downloads the current deck as a JSON file in exactly the
format above; *Settings → Export all cards* does the same for every deck at
once, and each quiz exports from its menu. All of them round-trip: import the
file you exported and every card updates in place, byte for byte, which
`tests/test_export.py` holds them to.

## Adding a question type

One file plus one line. `web/js/questions/<type>.js` exports an object with:

| Member | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `autoSubmit(question)` | submit as soon as an answer is picked? |
| `initialResponse(question)` | the blank response to start from |
| `render(question, state)` | HTML for the unanswered and marked states |
| `mount(root, q, state, ctx)` | wire up inputs; `ctx = {setResponse, submit}` |
| `canSubmit(question, state)` | is there enough of an answer to grade? |
| `grade(question, response)` | `true` / `false` |
| `summary(question, response)` | `{given, correct}` for the results page |
| `onKey(event, ...)` | optional; return `true` if the key was handled |
| `label(question)` | optional; short text for the results list |

Register it in `web/js/questions/index.js`, and add its validation rules to
`_validate_question` in `app/services/import_service.py` so bad data is caught at
import rather than at 2am mid-quiz.
